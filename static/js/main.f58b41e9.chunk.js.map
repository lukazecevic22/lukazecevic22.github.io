enchanting world of Pokémon.\r\n                        Today, the Pokémon family of products includes video games, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the Pokémon animated TV series, movies, toys, and much more.\r\n                        The games encourage strategic thinking and, in many cases, basic math skills. Pokémon puts a strong emphasis on good sportsmanship and respect for other players, as well.\r\n                        And many parents feel that the Pokémon TCG and Pokémon video games encourage their children to learn to read, since reading is required in most Pokémon games.\r\n                        What Are Pokémon?\r\n                        Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans.\r\n                        For the most part, Pokémon do not speak except to utter their names. Pokémon are raised and commanded by their owners (called “Trainers”).\r\n                        During their adventures, Pokémon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon.\r\n                        There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.\r\n                        Pokémon Video Games\r\n                        The first Pokémon video games were released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1998, and the series has driven the popularity of Pokémon ever since.\r\n                        Pokémon games have thus far appeared exclusively on Nintendo systems, including the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U console.\r\n                        In most games, the player takes on the role of a young Trainer whose journey involves traveling from place to place, catching and training Pokémon,\r\n                        and battling against other Trainers' Pokémon on a quest to become the Pokémon League Champion. An additional goal is to catch and catalog all of the many\r\n                        Pokémon within the game's world. Despite this battling aspect of the games, the Pokémon games avoid explicit violence; Pokémon never die during the course of the game.\r\n                        Trainers are invited to take part in many peripheral activities when playing, including talent and beauty contests, tournaments, and fishing (for Pokémon, of course!).\r\n                        Players can battle and trade Pokémon with other players as well, letting children learn the merits of sharing and sportsmanship.\r\n                         With newer video game systems, players can even play and trade online with other Trainers around the world.\r\n                         Pokémon Trading Card Game  \r\n                        In the Pokémon Trading Card Game, players build decks around their favorite Pokémon and then play against each other,\r\n                        sending their Pokémon into battle to prove who the best Pokémon Trainer is. Players can begin with theme decks—preconstructed decks designed to cover the basics of the game.\r\n                        Then, they can augment their card collections with booster packs that provide more cards, letting players develop more diverse decks.\r\n                        With thousands of cards to choose from, the game is never the same twice. The Pokémon Company International releases four sets of cards,\r\n                        called “expansions,” each year, so the game continues to evolve and expand for both players and collectors.Pokémon Animation\r\n                        The Pokémon animated series goes way back—almost to the time of Pokémon's origin as a video game. The show follows the adventures of a brash young Trainer\r\n                        named Ash Ketchum and his Pokémon pal Pikachu as they travel the world of Pokémon, visiting exotic destinations, meeting many interesting new people and Pokémon,\r\n                        and having lots of exciting adventures. Along the way, they learn about teamwork, compassion, friendship, and fair play as Ash works toward his goal of becoming a Pokémon Master.\r\n                        The Pokémon TV show is one of the most popular children's shows of all time and has spawned a series of animated films that also follow the adventures of Ash Ketchum and friends.\r\n                        The movies involve much greater stakes—often dealing with the legends of the Pokémon world.\r\n                        Learn more about Pokémon animation.\r\n                        Play! Pokémon\r\n                        To encourage play among Pokémon fans, The Pokémon Company International has established Play! Pokémon—a network designed for Pokémon\r\n                        players to find casual and competitive opportunities to play with each other. Initially created to give Pokémon Trading Card Game players the chance to meet, Play!\r\n                        Pokémon has expanded to include video game activities as well as general nongaming activities, such as Pokémon movie viewings and art sessions. Pokémon Leagues, tournaments,\r\n                        and Championship Series events give players chances to test strategies, trade Pokémon and TCG cards, and make new friends who share a common interest in Pokémon.\r\n                        The core value of the Play! Pokémon program is to provide a fun, organized playing environment where kids can grow socially and intellectually.\r\n                        Within the Play! Pokémon environment, an emphasis is placed on fun, fairness, honesty, respect, sportsmanship, and learning. In addition to promoting logical and strategic thinking,\r\n                        good sportsmanship, and core math and reading skills, the game's popularity has even led to parents and their children playing in the same events.\r\n                                            </p>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n            <Link to={\"/dashboard\"}>\r\n                <button className=\"btn btn-primary btn-block\">Return to pokepedia</button>\r\n            </Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\r\n\r\nexport default function Pokepedia() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div>\r\n                <button className=\"btn btn-primary btn-block\">Pokepedia</button>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"text\">\r\n                <h3>History of POKEMON</h3>\r\n                The history of the Pokémon media franchise spans over two decades\r\n                from when work began officially on the first game to now, and has roots even older.\r\n                It started simply enough as a hobby of Satoshi Tajiri, who as a child had a fondness\r\n                for catching insects and tadpoles near his home in suburban Tokyo. Over time, Tajiri\r\n                decided to put his idea of catching creatures into practice, to give children the same\r\n                 thrills he had as a child.\r\n         <h3>Early days</h3>\r\n                With the help of Ken Sugimori and other friends, Tajiri formed Game Freak and much later the design studio known as Creatures.\r\n                When Tajiri discovered the Game Boy and the Game Boy Game Link Cable, it gave him the image of insects traveling along the wire.\r\n                Tajiri was also heavily influenced by the Ultraman fantasy television show,\r\n                Ultra Seven, in which the protagonist used giant monsters contained within small capsules to help him fight. Together,\r\n                 these two sources gave him the idea for a new game called Capsule Monsters.After several\r\n                 failed attempts at pitching this idea to Nintendo, Tajiri's new friend Shigeru Miyamoto pitched it to the\r\n                 company, and Nintendo began to fund the project, spending six years developing the games that would become\r\n                 a worldwide sensation. Due to trademarking issues, the name \"Capsule Monsters\" was changed to \"Pocket Monsters\".\r\n                The original artwork for the games was drawn by Tajiri's friend, artist Ken Sugimori,\r\n                while the music and sound effects were composed by Junichi Masuda.\r\n                After debugging was completed, Shigeki Morimoto programmed Mew into the game. However,\r\n                Game Freak planned to keep the 151st Pokémon hidden from the public unless it was needed for a post-launch event.\r\n                The project nearly drove Game Freak to bankruptcy. Five employees quit due to the financial conditions, and Tajiri worked many unpaid hours.\r\n       <h3>Generation I</h3>\r\n                Taking over Japan\r\n               Pokémon Green box art\r\n               The first Pokémon games, Pokémon Red and Green Versions, came to the Nintendo Game Boy system in Japan on February 27, 1996, which was the fulfillment of Satoshi Tajiri's dream and allowed people of all ages to catch, train and trade 151 creatures and become a Pokémon Master.\r\n               Initially, the Pokémon games had modest sales. However, after players discovered Mew in the games, the magazine CoroCoro announced a \"Legendary Pokémon Offer\" to distribute Mew to twenty entrants. The contest received 78,000 entrants, and the sales of the Pokémon games quickly increased.[5] Due to high sales, Pokémon Red and Green were swiftly followed up with Pokémon Blue, which had improved graphics and sounds.\r\n               After the games, a Pokémon Trading Card Game was developed by Media Factory with its own set of rules. The first set of cards was released on October 20, 1996, containing 102 cards, and became very popular.\r\n               The franchise also won many manga interpretations, the first being Pokémon Pocket Monsters by Kosaku Anakubo, which was first collected and published in November 1996 by Shogakukan. This was chiefly a gag manga, using crude humor and slapstick, starring a Trainer named Red and his rude Clefairy.\r\n               The popularity of the franchise also led to an anime series based on the games, premiering in Japan on April 1, 1997. The main character was a young Pokémon Trainer named Satoshi (after Satoshi Tajiri, later dubbed in English to Ash Ketchum), based on Red. Another character introduced in the first episode was Satoshi's rival, Shigeru (after Shigeru Miyamoto, later dubbed in English to Gary Oak), based on Blue.\r\n               The anime quickly became very popular, and soon a manga series based on it named The Electric Tale of Pikachu was written by Toshihiro Ono. The first volume of the series was first published on October 28, 1997. The more famous manga in the western world, however, is Pokémon Adventures, with the first volume being published in Japan on August 8, 1997. It was one of the most successful Pokémon manga, with 150,000 copies sold worldwide. It is also the longest running manga in Pokémon history based on its starting date. Several other manga series were published in that era, including Pokémon Zensho and Miho Asada's Pokémon Gotta Catch 'Em All.\r\n               In addition to these manga series, Shogakukan also published the first volume of Pokémon Wonderland, a magazine with the latest information on the franchise, on August 23, 1997. They also released a new manga series named Pokémon PiPiPi ★ Adventures (later translated to Magical Pokémon Journey), authored by Yumi Tsukirino, on March 28, 1998. The main difference in this series was that is was aimed mainly towards girls.\r\n               On April 25, 1998, the first Pokémon Center store was opened in Tokyo, specializing in Pokémon merchandise. Along the way, The Pokémon Company began its operations. Many such stores were opened in later years, and today there are six different stores across Japan, as well as a subsection in the Nintendo World Store in New York.\r\n               Conquering the world\r\n               Ash Ketchum in the original series of the anime\r\n               Due to Pokémon's success in Japan, the series was released overseas. Before the games were released in North America, the localization team attempted to change the Pokémon designs, fearing that the cute designs would not appeal to western gamers; however, the proposal was refused.[6][7] North America received Red and Blue Versions, as well as the anime, in September 1998 (the anime on the 7th and the games on the 28th), and soon everywhere else began to play the games on the Game Boy under the slogan Gotta Catch 'em All!. The Trading Card Game was also introduced to North America on January 9, 1999 by Wizards of the Coast. The Electric Tale of Pikachu became the first Pokémon manga to be translated to English when VIZ Media started publishing it on September 28, 1999.\r\n               Meanwhile in Japan in 1998, a new spin-off game, Pokémon Stadium, was released for Nintendo 64. This game featured only 42 Pokémon of the full 151. This game proved to be commercially and critically unsuccessful, though its sequel, originally planned for the Nintendo 64DD, received an international release.\r\n               The anime, on the other hand, pushed the franchise to new heights. On July 18, 1998, Mewtwo Strikes Back debuted in Japanese theaters, featuring the rare Mew and Mewtwo. In the United States, where it was released on November 10, 1999, the movie even briefly held the record for highest-grossing opening for an animated film.\r\n               Plans soon started for a game based on the popular anime and Yellow Version was released September 12, 1998 in Japan, October 25, 1999 in North America and Europe. Pokémon Yellow allowed Trainers to take on the role of Ash and travel through Kanto with anime-style graphics for each Pokémon and a Pikachu by their side, following the anime's course of events.\r\n               Expanding to spin-offs\r\n               On December 18, 1998 a Game Boy game based on the TCG was released, later arriving in North America on April 10, 2000. It was followed, only in Japan, a year later by a sequel titled Pokémon Card GB2: Here Comes Team GR!.\r\n               The anime, as well as Pokémon Yellow, marked Pikachu as the most popular and recognized creatures in Pokémon history, turning it into the franchise's mascot. This led to a small spin-off game called Hey You, Pikachu!, which was released in Japan on December 12, 1998, and in North America on November 6, 2000. This was a virtual-pet game, utilizing the Nintendo 64's Voice Recognition Unit to let the players interact verbally with Pikachu.\r\n               When the anime finished following the games' story with Ash's defeat in the Pokémon League in January 1999, it started a new season in a new region called the Orange Archipelago, introducing the new main character of Tracey Sketchit. During this season's time, a second movie, The Power of One, was produced. It was first in Japanese theaters on July 17, 1999, and in North American theaters on July 21, 2000.\r\n               A non-traditional spin-off game for Nintendo 64, Pokémon Snap, was released in Japan on March 21, 1999, inviting the player (in the role of Todd) to a Pokémon photographing mission in a place called Pokémon Island. This game made its way to North America on July 27, 1999.\r\n               On April 14, 1999, a spin-off pinball game for the Game Boy Color was released, called Pokémon Pinball. This game took all the mechanics of regular pinball, with some Pokémon aspects added in. Its North American release was on June 28, 1999.\r\n               Pokémon Live! CD cover art\r\n               A sequel to Pokémon Stadium was also eventually released in Japan on April 30, 1999, and became a success. This game reached North America on February 29, 2000, and became known there as the original Pokémon Stadium. The twist in the Stadium series from the core series was that it featured the Pokémon in 3D.\r\n               In September 2000, the anime-based puzzle game Pokémon Puzzle League was released for Nintendo 64. This game was the only Pokémon game to be made specifically for western audiences and not be released in Japan.\r\n               However, this was not the only American-made original Pokémon material. From 2000 to 2002, an anime-based musical called Pokémon Live! was shown on stages around the world. The most memorable plot point in the musical was the revelation that Ash's mother, Delia, used to be a friend of Giovanni when they were younger. The musical isn't considered canon, but it sparked endless theories among fans regarding the identity of Ash's father.\r\n        <h3>Generation II</h3>\r\n                Winds of new beginnings\r\n                A map of Johto\r\n                Almost since the very beginning of the series, it had been apparent that the first 151 Pokémon would not be the last. Ho-Oh was seen as early as the first episode of the anime, Togepi was owned by a main character, and others like Marill, Snubbull and Donphan were seen in the first movie. Later, when the second generation of Pokémon was drawing nearer, others like Lugia, Slowking and Elekid made their way to the second movie.\r\n                On November 21, 1999, Nintendo of Japan released Gold and Silver Versions for the then-new Game Boy Color. This time, Trainers were invited to the land of Johto, where 100 more Pokémon were waiting to be captured. The new games enhanced the Pokémon gaming experience by adding many new features, the most famous likely being the ability for Pokémon to have different genders, in turn allowing them to breed. A time system was also introduced, with a real-time clock allowing different events to happen during the day, at night, and in the morning, as well as on certain days of the week. Another important addition was the friendship system. Shiny Pokémon also first appeared, most notably a Red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage. Trainers could also return to Kanto and face the Gym Leaders that were present in the original games. Pokémon Gold and Silver made its way to North America on October 11, 2000.\r\n                The anime followed, of course, and Ash and his friends also arrived at Johto in an episode that aired in Japan on October 14, 1999 and in the US on October 14, 2000. Spell of the Unown: Entei was then released to theaters on July 8, 2000 in Japan and on April 6, 2001 in North America, featuring the Legendary Entei.\r\n                A new trading card set called Neo Genesis featured the first Generation II Pokémon to the Trading Card Game. It was released in Japan on December 10, 1999 and in the United States on December 16, 2000.\r\n                A sequel to Pokémon Puzzle League was released on September 21, 2000 for Game Boy Color, this time in Japan, titled Pokémon Puzzle Challenge. It made its way to North America on December 4, 2000.\r\n                On December 14, 2000, Pokémon Stadium 2, bringing the Generation II Pokémon into full 3D for the first time. This game reached North America on March 25, 2001.\r\n                Like Pokémon Yellow, a third version was made called Pokémon Crystal, which was released in Japan on December 14, 2000 and in North America on July 21, 2001. Pokémon Crystal had several notable changes from Gold and Silver. Suicune was the game mascot and the focus of the plot. Crystal was also the first portable Pokémon game to feature animations for every Pokémon. Trainers in Japan received the added bonus of being able to trade, battle, and even obtain the Legendary Pokémon Celebi wirelessly by using a cell phone to connect to the Pokémon Mobile System GB. Trainers were also, for the first time, allowed to choose their character's gender.\r\n                Anime and manga in GS\r\n                Volume 8 of the Pokémon Adventures manga\r\n                DVD Cover for Mewtwo Returns\r\n                On December 30, 2000, the first feature-length special of the Pokémon anime was released in Japan as a sequel to Mewtwo Strikes Back, titled Mewtwo Returns. It was later released on DVD in the United States on December 5, 2001.\r\n                In June 2000, a manga series by Muneo Saitō titled Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys was published in Japan. This manga followed the plot of the Generation II games, before abruptly ending after three volumes with very little resolution. Another new manga series by Takashi Teshirogi based on the anime's new seasons called Ash & Pikachu was published on February 26, 2001.\r\n                Another anime movie, Celebi: The Voice of the Forest, debuted in theaters in Japan on July 7, 2001, and in North America on October 25, 2002. It featured two Legendary Pokémon prominent in Pokémon Crystal: Celebi and Suicune.\r\n                The Pokémon Adventures manga finally caught up to the second generation on August 8, 2001, when Volume 8 was published in Japan, starting a new chapter. This chapter was much longer than the previous chapters of the series, lasting no less than 7 full volumes. Additionally, this is the only volume to share its release date with future volumes in Japanese, being that the two after it were published at the same time.\r\n                Raikou, the only member of the Legendary beasts yet to be featured in an anime movie at the time, received its own made-for-TV special, The Legend of Thunder!, on December 30, 2001. This special didn't feature Ash and his friends, but rather new characters based on the player characters of the second generation.\r\n                On July 13, 2002, the fifth and final movie of the original series, Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias, was released in Japanese theaters. Distributed on limited release by Miramax Films, it opened in select American theaters on May 16, 2003.\r\n                        </p>\r\n            <Link to={\"/dashboard\"}>\r\n                <button className=\"btn btn-primary btn-block\">Return to pokepedia</button>\r\n            </Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Dashboard from './components/layout/Dashboard';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'\nimport { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Pokemon from './components/pokemon/Pokemon';\nimport PrivateRoute from './components/PrivateRoutes';\nimport PublicRoute from './public/PublicRoutes';\nimport { Register } from './public/component/Register';\nimport { Login } from './public/component/Login';\nimport About from './components/layout/About';\nimport Pokepedia from './components/layout/Pokepedia';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <BrowserRouter>\n        <div className=\"App\">\n          <Switch>\n            <PublicRoute component={Register} exect path=\"/register\" />\n            <PublicRoute component={Login} exect path=\"/login\" />\n            <PrivateRoute component={About} exact path=\"/about\" />\n            <PrivateRoute component={Pokepedia} exact path=\"/pokepedia\" />\n            <Route exact path=\"/pokemon/:pokemonIndex\" component={Pokemon} />\n            <PrivateRoute component={Dashboard} exact path=\"/dashboard\" />\n            <Redirect from=\"/\" to=\"login\"  />\n          </Switch>\n        </div>\n      </BrowserRouter>\n\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
