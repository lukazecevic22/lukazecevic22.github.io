Today, the Pok\xe9mon family of products includes video games, the Pok\xe9mon Trading Card Game, the Pok\xe9mon animated TV series, movies, toys, and much more. The games encourage strategic thinking and, in many cases, basic math skills. Pok\xe9mon puts a strong emphasis on good sportsmanship and respect for other players, as well. And many parents feel that the Pok\xe9mon TCG and Pok\xe9mon video games encourage their children to learn to read, since reading is required in most Pok\xe9mon games. What Are Pok\xe9mon? Pok\xe9mon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For the most part, Pok\xe9mon do not speak except to utter their names. Pok\xe9mon are raised and commanded by their owners (called \u201cTrainers\u201d). During their adventures, Pok\xe9mon grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pok\xe9mon. There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pok\xe9mon universe. Pok\xe9mon Video Games The first Pok\xe9mon video games were released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1998, and the series has driven the popularity of Pok\xe9mon ever since. Pok\xe9mon games have thus far appeared exclusively on Nintendo systems, including the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U console. In most games, the player takes on the role of a young Trainer whose journey involves traveling from place to place, catching and training Pok\xe9mon, and battling against other Trainers' Pok\xe9mon on a quest to become the Pok\xe9mon League Champion. An additional goal is to catch and catalog all of the many Pok\xe9mon within the game's world. Despite this battling aspect of the games, the Pok\xe9mon games avoid explicit violence; Pok\xe9mon never die during the course of the game. Trainers are invited to take part in many peripheral activities when playing, including talent and beauty contests, tournaments, and fishing (for Pok\xe9mon, of course!). Players can battle and trade Pok\xe9mon with other players as well, letting children learn the merits of sharing and sportsmanship. With newer video game systems, players can even play and trade online with other Trainers around the world. Pok\xe9mon Trading Card Game In the Pok\xe9mon Trading Card Game, players build decks around their favorite Pok\xe9mon and then play against each other, sending their Pok\xe9mon into battle to prove who the best Pok\xe9mon Trainer is. Players can begin with theme decks\u2014preconstructed decks designed to cover the basics of the game. Then, they can augment their card collections with booster packs that provide more cards, letting players develop more diverse decks. With thousands of cards to choose from, the game is never the same twice. The Pok\xe9mon Company International releases four sets of cards, called \u201cexpansions,\u201d each year, so the game continues to evolve and expand for both players and collectors.Pok\xe9mon Animation The Pok\xe9mon animated series goes way back\u2014almost to the time of Pok\xe9mon's origin as a video game. The show follows the adventures of a brash young Trainer named Ash Ketchum and his Pok\xe9mon pal Pikachu as they travel the world of Pok\xe9mon, visiting exotic destinations, meeting many interesting new people and Pok\xe9mon, and having lots of exciting adventures. Along the way, they learn about teamwork, compassion, friendship, and fair play as Ash works toward his goal of becoming a Pok\xe9mon Master. The Pok\xe9mon TV show is one of the most popular children's shows of all time and has spawned a series of animated films that also follow the adventures of Ash Ketchum and friends. The movies involve much greater stakes\u2014often dealing with the legends of the Pok\xe9mon world. Learn more about Pok\xe9mon animation. Play! Pok\xe9mon To encourage play among Pok\xe9mon fans, The Pok\xe9mon Company International has established Play! Pok\xe9mon\u2014a network designed for Pok\xe9mon players to find casual and competitive opportunities to play with each other. Initially created to give Pok\xe9mon Trading Card Game players the chance to meet, Play! Pok\xe9mon has expanded to include video game activities as well as general nongaming activities, such as Pok\xe9mon movie viewings and art sessions. Pok\xe9mon Leagues, tournaments, and Championship Series events give players chances to test strategies, trade Pok\xe9mon and TCG cards, and make new friends who share a common interest in Pok\xe9mon. The core value of the Play! Pok\xe9mon program is to provide a fun, organized playing environment where kids can grow socially and intellectually. Within the Play! Pok\xe9mon environment, an emphasis is placed on fun, fairness, honesty, respect, sportsmanship, and learning. In addition to promoting logical and strategic thinking, good sportsmanship, and core math and reading skills, the game's popularity has even led to parents and their children playing in the same events.")),o.a.createElement(b.b,{to:"/dashboard"},o.a.createElement("button",{className:"btn btn-primary btn-block"},"Return to pokepedia")))}function B(){return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("button",{className:"btn btn-primary btn-block"},"Pokepedia")),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"text"},o.a.createElement("h3",null,"History of POKEMON"),"The history of the Pok\xe9mon media franchise spans over two decades from when work began officially on the first game to now, and has roots even older. It started simply enough as a hobby of Satoshi Tajiri, who as a child had a fondness for catching insects and tadpoles near his home in suburban Tokyo. Over time, Tajiri decided to put his idea of catching creatures into practice, to give children the same thrills he had as a child.",o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Early days"),'With the help of Ken Sugimori and other friends, Tajiri formed Game Freak and much later the design studio known as Creatures. When Tajiri discovered the Game Boy and the Game Boy Game Link Cable, it gave him the image of insects traveling along the wire. Tajiri was also heavily influenced by the Ultraman fantasy television show, Ultra Seven, in which the protagonist used giant monsters contained within small capsules to help him fight. Together, these two sources gave him the idea for a new game called Capsule Monsters.After several failed attempts at pitching this idea to Nintendo, Tajiri\'s new friend Shigeru Miyamoto pitched it to the company, and Nintendo began to fund the project, spending six years developing the games that would become a worldwide sensation. Due to trademarking issues, the name "Capsule Monsters" was changed to "Pocket Monsters". The original artwork for the games was drawn by Tajiri\'s friend, artist Ken Sugimori, while the music and sound effects were composed by Junichi Masuda. After debugging was completed, Shigeki Morimoto programmed Mew into the game. However, Game Freak planned to keep the 151st Pok\xe9mon hidden from the public unless it was needed for a post-launch event. The project nearly drove Game Freak to bankruptcy. Five employees quit due to the financial conditions, and Tajiri worked many unpaid hours.',o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Generation I"),"Taking over Japan Pok\xe9mon Green box art The first Pok\xe9mon games, Pok\xe9mon Red and Green Versions, came to the Nintendo Game Boy system in Japan on February 27, 1996, which was the fulfillment of Satoshi Tajiri's dream and allowed people of all ages to catch, train and trade 151 creatures and become a Pok\xe9mon Master. Initially, the Pok\xe9mon games had modest sales. However, after players discovered Mew in the games, the magazine CoroCoro announced a \"Legendary Pok\xe9mon Offer\" to distribute Mew to twenty entrants. The contest received 78,000 entrants, and the sales of the Pok\xe9mon games quickly increased.[5] Due to high sales, Pok\xe9mon Red and Green were swiftly followed up with Pok\xe9mon Blue, which had improved graphics and sounds. After the games, a Pok\xe9mon Trading Card Game was developed by Media Factory with its own set of rules. The first set of cards was released on October 20, 1996, containing 102 cards, and became very popular. The franchise also won many manga interpretations, the first being Pok\xe9mon Pocket Monsters by Kosaku Anakubo, which was first collected and published in November 1996 by Shogakukan. This was chiefly a gag manga, using crude humor and slapstick, starring a Trainer named Red and his rude Clefairy. The popularity of the franchise also led to an anime series based on the games, premiering in Japan on April 1, 1997. The main character was a young Pok\xe9mon Trainer named Satoshi (after Satoshi Tajiri, later dubbed in English to Ash Ketchum), based on Red. Another character introduced in the first episode was Satoshi's rival, Shigeru (after Shigeru Miyamoto, later dubbed in English to Gary Oak), based on Blue. The anime quickly became very popular, and soon a manga series based on it named The Electric Tale of Pikachu was written by Toshihiro Ono. The first volume of the series was first published on October 28, 1997. The more famous manga in the western world, however, is Pok\xe9mon Adventures, with the first volume being published in Japan on August 8, 1997. It was one of the most successful Pok\xe9mon manga, with 150,000 copies sold worldwide. It is also the longest running manga in Pok\xe9mon history based on its starting date. Several other manga series were published in that era, including Pok\xe9mon Zensho and Miho Asada's Pok\xe9mon Gotta Catch 'Em All. In addition to these manga series, Shogakukan also published the first volume of Pok\xe9mon Wonderland, a magazine with the latest information on the franchise, on August 23, 1997. They also released a new manga series named Pok\xe9mon PiPiPi \u2605 Adventures (later translated to Magical Pok\xe9mon Journey), authored by Yumi Tsukirino, on March 28, 1998. The main difference in this series was that is was aimed mainly towards girls. On April 25, 1998, the first Pok\xe9mon Center store was opened in Tokyo, specializing in Pok\xe9mon merchandise. Along the way, The Pok\xe9mon Company began its operations. Many such stores were opened in later years, and today there are six different stores across Japan, as well as a subsection in the Nintendo World Store in New York. Conquering the world Ash Ketchum in the original series of the anime Due to Pok\xe9mon's success in Japan, the series was released overseas. Before the games were released in North America, the localization team attempted to change the Pok\xe9mon designs, fearing that the cute designs would not appeal to western gamers; however, the proposal was refused.[6][7] North America received Red and Blue Versions, as well as the anime, in September 1998 (the anime on the 7th and the games on the 28th), and soon everywhere else began to play the games on the Game Boy under the slogan Gotta Catch 'em All!. The Trading Card Game was also introduced to North America on January 9, 1999 by Wizards of the Coast. The Electric Tale of Pikachu became the first Pok\xe9mon manga to be translated to English when VIZ Media started publishing it on September 28, 1999. Meanwhile in Japan in 1998, a new spin-off game, Pok\xe9mon Stadium, was released for Nintendo 64. This game featured only 42 Pok\xe9mon of the full 151. This game proved to be commercially and critically unsuccessful, though its sequel, originally planned for the Nintendo 64DD, received an international release. The anime, on the other hand, pushed the franchise to new heights. On July 18, 1998, Mewtwo Strikes Back debuted in Japanese theaters, featuring the rare Mew and Mewtwo. In the United States, where it was released on November 10, 1999, the movie even briefly held the record for highest-grossing opening for an animated film. Plans soon started for a game based on the popular anime and Yellow Version was released September 12, 1998 in Japan, October 25, 1999 in North America and Europe. Pok\xe9mon Yellow allowed Trainers to take on the role of Ash and travel through Kanto with anime-style graphics for each Pok\xe9mon and a Pikachu by their side, following the anime's course of events. Expanding to spin-offs On December 18, 1998 a Game Boy game based on the TCG was released, later arriving in North America on April 10, 2000. It was followed, only in Japan, a year later by a sequel titled Pok\xe9mon Card GB2: Here Comes Team GR!. The anime, as well as Pok\xe9mon Yellow, marked Pikachu as the most popular and recognized creatures in Pok\xe9mon history, turning it into the franchise's mascot. This led to a small spin-off game called Hey You, Pikachu!, which was released in Japan on December 12, 1998, and in North America on November 6, 2000. This was a virtual-pet game, utilizing the Nintendo 64's Voice Recognition Unit to let the players interact verbally with Pikachu. When the anime finished following the games' story with Ash's defeat in the Pok\xe9mon League in January 1999, it started a new season in a new region called the Orange Archipelago, introducing the new main character of Tracey Sketchit. During this season's time, a second movie, The Power of One, was produced. It was first in Japanese theaters on July 17, 1999, and in North American theaters on July 21, 2000. A non-traditional spin-off game for Nintendo 64, Pok\xe9mon Snap, was released in Japan on March 21, 1999, inviting the player (in the role of Todd) to a Pok\xe9mon photographing mission in a place called Pok\xe9mon Island. This game made its way to North America on July 27, 1999. On April 14, 1999, a spin-off pinball game for the Game Boy Color was released, called Pok\xe9mon Pinball. This game took all the mechanics of regular pinball, with some Pok\xe9mon aspects added in. Its North American release was on June 28, 1999. Pok\xe9mon Live! CD cover art A sequel to Pok\xe9mon Stadium was also eventually released in Japan on April 30, 1999, and became a success. This game reached North America on February 29, 2000, and became known there as the original Pok\xe9mon Stadium. The twist in the Stadium series from the core series was that it featured the Pok\xe9mon in 3D. In September 2000, the anime-based puzzle game Pok\xe9mon Puzzle League was released for Nintendo 64. This game was the only Pok\xe9mon game to be made specifically for western audiences and not be released in Japan. However, this was not the only American-made original Pok\xe9mon material. From 2000 to 2002, an anime-based musical called Pok\xe9mon Live! was shown on stages around the world. The most memorable plot point in the musical was the revelation that Ash's mother, Delia, used to be a friend of Giovanni when they were younger. The musical isn't considered canon, but it sparked endless theories among fans regarding the identity of Ash's father.",o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Generation II"),"Winds of new beginnings A map of Johto Almost since the very beginning of the series, it had been apparent that the first 151 Pok\xe9mon would not be the last. Ho-Oh was seen as early as the first episode of the anime, Togepi was owned by a main character, and others like Marill, Snubbull and Donphan were seen in the first movie. Later, when the second generation of Pok\xe9mon was drawing nearer, others like Lugia, Slowking and Elekid made their way to the second movie. On November 21, 1999, Nintendo of Japan released Gold and Silver Versions for the then-new Game Boy Color. This time, Trainers were invited to the land of Johto, where 100 more Pok\xe9mon were waiting to be captured. The new games enhanced the Pok\xe9mon gaming experience by adding many new features, the most famous likely being the ability for Pok\xe9mon to have different genders, in turn allowing them to breed. A time system was also introduced, with a real-time clock allowing different events to happen during the day, at night, and in the morning, as well as on certain days of the week. Another important addition was the friendship system. Shiny Pok\xe9mon also first appeared, most notably a Red Gyarados at the Lake of Rage.
